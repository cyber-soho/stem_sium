STEM Integrative Project Assessment Frameworks

Context: Institutional Assessment Standardization Proposal

Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and conceptual designs for the Competency-Based Assessment Framework proposed for the STEM Integrative Project sequence (CS 251, CS 252, and CS 353).

These interactive HTML artifacts were developed to address specific pedagogical gaps in the current assessment standardization process, specifically regarding practical, hands-on engineering courses.

Repository Contents

The repository consists of four self-contained interactive dashboards, developed as Single Page Applications (SPAs) to visualize the proposed grading models:

index.html (Assessment Portal): The central hub connecting the individual project proposals.

project_1.html (CS 251): Proposal for Integrative Project I, focusing on core logic and OOP principles.

project_2.html (CS 252): Proposal for Integrative Project II, focusing on systems integration and database design.

project_3.html (CS 353): Proposal for Integrative Project III, focusing on full-stack deployment and Agile methodology.

Background & Rationale

These frameworks were conceptualized and coded in response to a directive from the Associate Dean of STEM regarding the Fall term assessment standardization.

As detailed in the internal correspondence, standard proctored examinations do not sufficiently measure student proficiency in applied project environments. Consequently, this repository proposes a shift to a Rubric-Based Performance Scale, assessing:

Methodology & Requirements Analysis

Technical Implementation

Analytical Rigor

Lab/Tool Proficiency

Professional Communication
